v1.1	6.jan 2011
Fixed bug: If Unzipper.ItemList had more than one entry, unzip would not work (exctracted files would try to overwrite themself)

Update zlib dlls to custom build v1.2.5.1 where 2 bugs fixed:
-Adding over 64k number of entries in zip with total size below 4GB created invalid zip
-Writing entries over 4GB with zip64=false did not fail but created invalid zip 

Misc:
Convert unsafe code to safe code.
Wrap CloseCurrentEntry in try/finally block: we must always CloseFile, even if CloseCurrentEntry fails.
Zip64 zipping works now.
