Bug fixes for contrib/MiniZip in zlib 1.2.5.

1.2.5.1:

unzip.c.patch fixes following problem:
In gcc 64bit, long can be 8 bytes and (unsingned long)-1 will become 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (incorrect). Replace with 0xFFFFFFFF.

zip.c.patch fixes following problem:
-Adding over 64k entries created invalid zip if zip was smaller than 4GB (line 1922)
-If entry became larger than 4GB and file was added with zip64=0, there is no room in local header extra info for zip64 info, but this was just ignored without error. Now it set 'err = ZIP_BADZIPFILE' (possibly it should 'return ZIP_BADZIPFILE', but I guess that doesn't make much difference).
-Corner case bug/consistency: compressed size can be larger than uncompressed size (Line 1713)
-Indentation (line 1855)
